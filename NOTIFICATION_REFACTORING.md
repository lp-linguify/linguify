# Notification System Refactoring

## Overview

This document summarizes the refactoring work done to resolve circular dependencies in the notification system. The refactoring improves code maintainability, resolves circular dependencies, and prepares the system for better integration with Redis for WebSockets.

## Key Changes

### 1. Centralized Type Definitions

- Created `/frontend/src/core/types/notification.types.ts` with all shared type definitions
- Moved enums, interfaces, and DTOs to this central location
- All notification modules now import types from this file rather than from each other

### 2. Updated Service Imports

- Refactored imports in:
  - `NotificationContext.tsx`
  - `notificationApi.ts`
  - `notificationService.ts`
  - `notificationWebsocket.ts`
  - `notificationManager.ts`
  - `notificationStorage.ts`
  - `notificationLifecycle.ts`

### 3. Code Enhancements

- Introduced caching for notification icons
- Simplified notification rendering
- Improved type safety with consistent type usage

### 4. Integration with Redis

- Updated Docker Compose configuration for Redis
- Added networking support for Redis container
- Updated Django settings to use Redis for channel layers
- Added environment variable support for Redis host configuration

### 5. Testing

- Created a test script to verify circular dependencies are resolved
- The test imports all notification-related modules and creates test notifications

## How to Run

### Starting Redis

Start the Redis server with:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.redis.yml up -d
```

### Running the Django Application with Redis

Ensure Redis is running, then start the Django application:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Creating Test Notifications

To create a test notification:

```bash
python create_notification.py
```

## Benefits

- **Improved Code Maintainability**: Clear service boundaries and centralized types
- **Resolved Circular Dependencies**: No more import loops causing runtime errors
- **Better Type Safety**: Consistent type usage across the entire notification system
- **Scalability**: Redis integration enables scaling WebSockets across multiple instances
- **Performance**: Redis provides efficient message distribution and pub/sub capabilities

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Implement notification WebSocket consumers in Django
2. ✅ Add notification subscription handling on the frontend
3. ✅ Update frontend notification drop-down component
4. ✅ Implement browser push notifications for offline notifications
5. ✅ Create test utilities for notification system

## Testing Utilities

A comprehensive testing utility has been added to help verify and test the notification system:

- `TestNotificationPanel` - A UI component for creating test notifications (available in dev mode)
- Enhanced test functions in `test-notification-system.ts` for programmatic testing
- Added documentation in `/docs/backend/features/notification_testing.md`

These testing utilities make it easy to:
- Create notifications of any type
- Test both legacy and enhanced notification systems
- Verify that notifications appear correctly in the UI
- Test actions and handlers for different notification types
