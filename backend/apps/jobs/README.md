### Option 1: .gitignore (Recommended)

Add to your `.gitignore`:

```
# Private job management system
backend/apps/jobs/
frontend/src/core/api/jobsApi.ts
```

### Option 2: Private Fork

Maintain this module in a private fork or separate repository that gets pulled into production deployments.

### Option 3: Environment Toggle

Add to `settings.py`:

```python
# Only include jobs app in production
if os.environ.get('ENABLE_JOBS_MODULE', 'false').lower() == 'true':
    INSTALLED_APPS.append('apps.jobs')
```

## üß™ Testing

Run tests:

```bash
python manage.py test apps.jobs
```

Tests cover:
- Model functionality
- API endpoints
- Application submission
- Data validation

## üîê Security Considerations

- **No Authentication Required**: Public API for job listings
- **Admin Only**: Job management requires superuser access
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated
- **Email Protection**: Application emails are not exposed in listings
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limiting for application submissions
